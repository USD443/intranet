Internal link management application used by Unified School District 443 (USD443)

## Objective

The goal of this application is to provide students and staff with quick access to links that are used commonly throughout the school district.

**USD443-Intranet** was designed to be viewed on student laptops (1280 - 720 resolution) and iPads. As such, a mobile-first approach was necessary. Styling and animations are kept minimal and professional.

## Technology

This entire project was built using the Svelte javascript framework.
